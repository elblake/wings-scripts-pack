A set of scripts for use with Wings3D with the scripting plugin installed.

Explanation of file types in the pack:

.wscr
These files contain information about the script, such as its name, the kind of
script it is (import, export, etc.), and a short description that appears in the
script chooser dialog. The .py or .scm file with the same name before the
extension as the .wscr file is the script that the script chooser will run.
Every script needs a .wscr file for it to appear in the script chooser dialog.
Scripts that generate new shapes don't have a mode setting, importers use
mode "import", exporters use mode "export", and simple commands that modify
point coordinates or change vertex attributes of an object use
mode "simple_body_command"

.inclr
To keep the .wscr file small, information such as the parameter dialog content,
and many settings for the script are in a separate .inclr file, usually called
script_name_dialog.inclr, which is referenced from a script_name.wscr file with:
include "(%)_dialog.inclr"
The "(%)" auto expands to the file name "script_name" before the .wscr extension.

.py
Python source files.

.scm
Scheme source files.
